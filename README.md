# JSProject Proposal

I want to use canvas in order to create a pond with koi fish in it.

I will use trigonometry to give the koi fish a more natural movement. Fish should move in a general direction, but since they are fish they will also have a slight aspect of random movement. The fish should also have tails that move similar to normal fish, to give the illusion of propulsion. Once I get more progress in, each fish object will have to record its past positions in the past ~3seconds, in order to determine where their tail really should be (if the fish is moving faster, then the tail should be 'wagging' faster as well.)

#User Interaction

Users will be able to drop food into the pond, which will cause the koi fish to swim towards the food. Also, when the food hits the water, there should be a rippling effect in the water.

The closer the fish is to the food, the faster the fish will swim. Fish farther away from the food will not swim as quickly towards the food.

Users will also be able to press buttons on the side in order to create waves. Waves should generally displace the food floating on the water, as well as the fish swimming through the water

#Implementation Timeline
Monday Dec 4: Get fish to move around pseudo-randomly, fix the edge motions
Tuesday: Start having the actual circle turn into a fish, mimic how the fish body moves around (including the tail)
Wednesday: Implement the food, have the fish swim towards the food.
Thursday: Add in the waves as well as visual effects.
